<h1> A List of The Worst Parts</h1>
<h2> A full list of some of the worst things to happen to be in 2020</h2>
<p> * A Note: Sorry to be depressing, but that’s how the year’s been going.*</p>
<ol> 
<li> I went to Europe where I had crippling depression due to missing my friends from home and hating the new people I had befriended. </li>
<li> One of these people I befriended turned out to be extremely mean and made me cry on multiple occasions. </li>
<li> One of the boys in the friend group was extremely racist and would get mad at me every time I called him out for being racist. </li>
<li> I was put in a semester-long group project with a boy who would mansplain our project to me <i> incorrectly </i> and then proceed to not help with any of the work.  </li>
<li> My dream internship at an advertising agency in Chicago was cancelled due to coronavirus.</li>
<li> I was kicked out of my abroad program due to coronavirus and sent back to the United States.</li>
<li> When I arrived home, I discovered I had contracted coronavirus and had to quarantine alone for two weeks. </li>
<li> I nannied for two devil children over the summer who made me cry a minimum of once a week. These children also made me never want to have kids. </li>
<li> I arrived at college and discovered all of my classes were asynchronous and online, meaning I wouldn’t get to see any of my class friends for my senior year of college. </li>
<li> Due to the lack of classes and in-person interaction, my depression worsened. </li>
<li> I failed my first finance exam receiving a 42% which was then curved down to a 21%.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Overall I’d give 2020 a 0/20. </h3>
