<h2> A Little Bit About Me</h2>
<p> Hello, my name is Annie Plunkett and I am a senior at UW-Madison. I am studying Marketing with a certificate in Digital Studies. After college I hope to be in Chicago with a role in account management at an advertising agency. </p>
<p> For some background, I am from Minneapolis, MN where I lived with my mom Babs, my dad Steve, and my brothers Ryan and Connor. </p>
<p> You can learn more about me and some of the work I have done at my portfolio website which you can access <a href="http://annieplunkettportfolio.weebly.com/" target="_blank"> at My Portfolio Site. </a> </p>
