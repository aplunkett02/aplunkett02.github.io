<h1> My 2020 Coping Mechanisms</h1>
<h2> While there was a lot of bad, I did my best to entertain myself with some good.</h2>
<h3> Baking </h3>
	<p> I took time making bagels, challah, cream puffs, creme brûlée, macrons, and other fun treats. </p>

<h3> Art </h3>
<p> Over the year I have done many little art projects; however, the one I am most proud of its a journal that I have been slowly adding to throughout the year. </p>
